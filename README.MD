# A Work Day Calendar Code Refractor

## Description
This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebAPI's and Third Party API's to produce a calendar that allows the user to schedule important items throughout the work day. HTML and CSS basics were given and slight modifications were made to both. For HTML, it was including the 9 a.m.-5 p.m. timeframe blocks. The JavaScript allows the user to view past, present and future times by applying CSS classes to color code.

# Installation
1. jQuery
2. Bootstrap
3. moment.js

# Usage

The application uses prompted save buttons to allow the user to save important events within their work day to local Storage. The user can see the current day displayed at the top of the application and the time by the color coded classses given by CSS. Past time will reflect as grey, present as red and future as green blocks.
